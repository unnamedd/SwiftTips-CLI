# Swift tips & tricks by [John Sundell](https://github.com/JohnSundell)

The main goal of this second project (the first one is the [framework](https://github.com/unnamedd/SwiftTips-Framework)) is just to have some fun and parsing those tips and tricks created by John. This project isn't official. If you have any question, you can talk directly to him on [twitter](https://twitter.com/johnsundell) or at [swiftbysundell.com](https://www.swiftbysundell.com).

In this repo, you will not see any trick (just the use of them :P), I recommend you to access the original repo and star it.
